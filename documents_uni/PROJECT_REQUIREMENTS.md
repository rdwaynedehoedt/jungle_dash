## üèóÔ∏è Required Architecture Components

### 1. Software Design Principles (Low Coupling & High Cohesion)

**Main Components:**

#### Player Class
- **Responsibility:** Player position and movement
- **Methods:** moveLeft(), moveRight(), getPosition(), checkBounds()
- **Properties:** x, y, speed, isAlive

#### ObstacleManager
- **Responsibility:** Spawn and move obstacles
- **Methods:** spawnObstacle(), moveObstacles(), clearObstacles(), getDifficulty()
- **Properties:** obstacles[], spawnRate, speed

#### GameController
- **Responsibility:** Game state, scoring, collisions, difficulty
- **Methods:** startGame(), pauseGame(), endGame(), checkCollision(), updateScore()
- **Properties:** score, gameState, difficulty, isRunning

#### UI Manager
- **Responsibility:** Display UI elements and screens
- **Methods:** showScore(), showTrivia(), showGameOver(), showStartScreen()
- **Properties:** currentScreen, elements

#### Auth Module
- **Responsibility:** Username login and score storage
- **Methods:** login(), saveScore(), getHighScores()
- **Properties:** username, highScores[]

**Design Principles:**
- ‚úÖ **Low Coupling:** Classes communicate via functions and events (not direct dependencies)
- ‚úÖ **High Cohesion:** Each module has clear, single responsibility

---

### 2. Event-Driven Programming

**Required Events:**

| Event Type | Trigger | Handler | Result |
|------------|---------|---------|--------|
| **Movement Event** | Keyboard (Arrow keys) | Player.move() | Player position updates |
| **Obstacle Spawn Event** | Timer/Interval | ObstacleManager.spawn() | New obstacle appears |
| **Collision Event** | Player hits obstacle | GameController.handleCollision() | Trivia modal opens |
| **Trivia Answer Event** | User submits answer | GameController.checkAnswer() | Continue or Game Over |
| **Score Increase Event** | Time elapsed | GameController.updateScore() | Score increments |
| **Game State Event** | Game start/pause/end | GameController.setState() | UI updates |

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use event listeners for keyboard input
- Timer-based events for obstacle spawning
- Custom events for game state changes
- Event emitter pattern for decoupling

---

### 3. Interoperability

**Heart Game API Integration:**
- **API URL:** https://marcconrad.com/uob/heart/
- **Documentation:** https://marcconrad.com/uob/heart/doc.php
- **Purpose:** Fetch trivia questions on collision
- **Protocol:** HTTP/HTTPS REST API
- **Data Format:** JSON

**Example API Usage:**
```javascript
// Fetch trivia question
fetch('https://marcconrad.com/uob/heart/api/question')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => displayTrivia(data))
```

**Score Storage Options:**
- External JSON file
- REST API endpoint
- localStorage (browser-based)
- Backend database integration

**Key Points:**
- Code must work with external systems
- Use Axios for HTTP requests
- Validate API responses with Zod
- Handle API errors gracefully

---

### 4. Virtual Identity (Authentication)

**Requirements:**
- Username input **before** game starts
- Associate scores with username
- Store username for session
- Enable future leaderboard integration

**Authentication Flow:**
```
1. Display login screen
2. User enters username
3. Validate username (non-empty)
4. Store username in session
5. Start game
6. Save score with username on game over
7. Display in leaderboard (future)
```

**Implementation:**
- Simple username-based auth (no password required for basic version)
- Use localStorage or cookies to persist username
- Associate high scores with username
- Optional: Add password for enhanced security
