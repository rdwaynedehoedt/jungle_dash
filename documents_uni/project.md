Completing your assignment
What am I required to do in this assignment?
This assignment asks you to reflect on various concepts, paradigms and architectures related to Computer Science. Based on your code you will do a
video to discuss the four themes software design principles (low coupling and high cohesion), event-driven programming, interoperability, and
virtual identity. You will develop code in a main-stream programming language chosen by you. Your main submission is the video; but you will also
submit supporting evidence that shows that you worked on the code.
Example code will be demonstrated during the practical sessions using Java and Eclipse; there will also be some discussion of JavaScript and PHP.
This is an individual assignment.
The Code:
You are asked to develop a game using the ‘Heart Game’ API - https://marcconrad.com/uob/heart/doc.php Basic examples are available in Java
https://github.com/marcconrad/comparativeintegratedsystems and JavaScript https://marcconrad.com/uob/heart/. You can develop code based on
these examples or do your own code from scratch (using any programming language). The final code must be sufficiently complex for you to produce
a meaningful video. For this reason, you should regularly discuss your progress with the tutor during the practical session.
Timeline of the Assignment
Week Tasks Software topics covered
1 Introduction to the IDE and basic
examples.
Overview of different programming
language, history, application areas.

expected to use external sources and
document their use.
GUI and Events
4 Interoperability
5 Authentication & Cookies
6
From Week 6 onward we will cover
further topics in the lecture that do not
relate directly to the four topics to be
covered in your video.

8 Feedback session with tutor to check
progress
9 Finalize code based on feedback
received.
10 Production of video and additional
material.
11 Assignment Submission Revision Session for Exam

Exam Week No Lecture
Deliverables:
1. An authentic video of maximum 10 minutes length where you talk about your code and compare and reflect upon the four themes software
design principles, interoperability, event-driven programming and virtual identity.
2. Additional material to accompany the video; this must include the full source code of a working implementation. If you use any code from
others (other students, external websites, LLMs) this must be referenced within the documentation of the source code. You may also
include a transcript of the video, design documentation, evidence of testing and integration of external software. Note that this additional
material is not marked directly but only serves to inform the video.
3. Evidence that you presented your work to the tutor in Week 8 or earlier.
Please note that this is an individual assignment. Although you can and should collaborate with other students you have to individually produce the
video, and you are individually responsible for the submission of all the additional material. You must also make clear what code has been written by you
and where you used code from others.
In Week 8, or earlier, you will present your work to the tutor. This session serves to provide evidence that you are actively working on your code.
The grade will be capped by 58 if your submission has one of the following issues. The grade will be capped by 48 if your submission has two or more of
the following issues:
• You did not present your code in or before Week 8.
• Code does not address the requirements of the case study.
• No dedicated submission of code (code only visible in video)
• Your video does not have your own voice.
The video must use relevant terminology and be focused around the four themes. It should start with a short demonstration of the working system
followed by substantive discussion of the four themes within the context of your code. The video must be authentic, i.e., it should be obvious that the
video reflects your understanding and knowledge of the code and the four themes. Substantive editing of the video is therefore discouraged.
Further Notes
Please check BREO regularly for further clarifications and details on the tasks. Take note of the FAQ that answers several questions about the
assignment.
Note that copying someone else’s code is plagiarism and hence an academic offence. However, the following is allowed and encouraged:
To ask other students for help, to ask for guidance and help in internet forums, use of example code that is available on the internet or in books, use of
third-party scripts, code generated by large language models (generative AI). Any such help must be clearly acknowledged and referenced. Any
embedded code which does not originate from you must be clearly marked as such; however, you can freely use the example code provided on the
BREO site of the unit. If in doubt, ask your tutor if and how you can use a particular source. References to other software used should be made in the
format of comments in your code.
Submissions after the hand-in date will not be accepted unless mitigation has been approved by the University’s Student Engagement and Mitigation
Team. Please see https://www.beds.ac.uk/student-support/mitigation/ for details.
What do I need to do to pass? How do I achieve a good grade?
In order to pass you need to submit a video where you explain code in a meaningful way; see the marking rubric, column “40%-49%” below for details.
For a good grade make sure to attend the (a) lectures to understand the essence of the topics that the video is about and (b) the practical sessions where
you can and should discuss the progress of your software artefact with your tutor.
How will my assignment be marked?
Your assignment will be marked according to the threshold expectations (see the Unit Information Form uploaded on BREO) and the specific marking
criteria below (marking rubric). Please read carefully as they will help you prepare and evaluate your own work before you submit. They will also help
you understand the grade and feedback received once marked.

Additional information
How does this assignment relate to ‘my learning in this unit and help me develop knowledge and skills that I will need for my future?
In the lectures we will discuss the various topics that you will implement into code and discuss in the video. The practical sessions provide time and
opportunity to discuss your progress with the tutor. Example code will be provided in Java and JavaScript; but you are free to use a different programming
language for this assignment.
Within the University of Bedfordshire, graduate competencies refer to the skills, knowledge, attributes, and abilities that individuals are expected to possess
upon completing their education at the graduate level. Our graduate competencies are the fundamental building blocks in preparing you for the future world
of work. They form the foundation for learning outcomes within and beyond your course. They are relevant for every subject, and you can work towards them
in different ways, so that you can attain and benefit from them even if you have lots going on outside university. These competencies will be integrated
across your course and units.
The table below indicates graduate competencies gained relevant to this assessment.
Graduate competencies:
Digital Literacy ✔
Collaboration and Communication ✔

What should I be aware of when preparing my work? How and where should I submit my work?
To submit assignments at the University of Bedfordshire, you will typically use the BREO (Bedfordshire Resources for Education Online) platform. Within
BREO, locate the specific assessment you need to submit, and then follow the instructions provided to upload your work.
The University has produced a guide that is designed to help you understand the processes we use to deliver and manage assessment-related processes,
what support is available to you and how we agree and approve your results. It also provides you with an explanation of the codes we use when we issue
results and transcripts.
When submitting work for assessment, you must ensure that it is all your own work. Failure to do this could result in sanctions, including removal from your
course. The Academic Integrity Resource (AIR) has been designed to introduce you to academic integrity and how to demonstrate this during your studies.
Remember to use the self-help resources to support your skills in academic writing. You could also Improve your assignment grades by accessing free
university support to develop a wide range of relevant and valuable academic skills.
For exams, you should familiarise yourself with the guidance information available here: https://www.beds.ac.uk/exams/
Practice exams can be taken for all exam types before exams week. Please see section Prepare for your exam.
